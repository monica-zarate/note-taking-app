# BCIT 4590 - Notes Application

## Quality Assurance Project

Hello and welcome to this Note-taking application!

- This site makes use of CRUD operations to access a SQL database of courses notes. It has the ability to create new entries, as wells as read, edit and delete existing ones.

- The structure of this app consists on two main sections: The app folder, were the Classes, Functions and Init files are located.

- The second section is the public folder, which contains all the mark-up for the website, and is reaching to the database through the logic stated on the app folder and prints out the notes on the browser by making use of partials files, like the header and footer sections, the card component, as well as the create, edit and delete note pages.

- For this second iteration of this project, I've also added the users folder, inside of the public folder, where we find the logic to create a new user, login and logout of the application.
